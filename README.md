# Analysis model of the benefits brought about by digitization


## Objectives and aims of the model

The ultimate goal of the analysis model of the benefits brought about by digitization is to provide the various departments involved with summary indicators on a homogeneous calculation basis of the benefits deriving from the initiatives implemented.

The structure of the model allows for a double evaluation:
*	Ex-ante potential benefit assessments (theoretical benefit)
*	Ex-post final evaluation of the benefits obtained (monitoring)

1.	Identification of the macro-activities most impacted by the digital project
2.	Mapping of the processes impacted by the digital application 
3.	Calculation of the benefits for the stakeholders impacted by the initiative

## Synthetic KPI for the quantification of benefits
The quantification of the benefits of digitization is summarized in 6 indicators, of which 3 refer to the PA and 3 to the Citizen, to show the double effect of digitization in terms of improving the efficiency of the PA's organizational structure and improving the level of service offered to citizens.
